- add a dialog box to configure whether to play a random sound, or a
specific sound, or a user-selected soundfile.

- make the (above) config dialog also show the filenames of the buffer
files that are currently being monitored (for diagnostic purposes, since
it might possibly not be determined correctly)

- some people have pointed out that monitoring the buffer files for
block count increases is not reliable, particularly if people have their
flush limit set to 1 (in which case a block is written and immediately
flushed, possibly before MooSounds notices). Maybe MooSounds only needs
to monitor for any modifications to the buffer files at all (and limit
the frequency of mooing to one per 2 minutes or something, to prevent
redundant moos caused by a triggered flush)

- if file modifications are to be monitored, then the Win32 API function
FindFirstChangeNotification() can be used in a secondary thread to receive
notifications of changes in the directory containing the buffers and
then checking the modification timestamps on each of the files to see
if any of the buffers have legitimately been modified.
